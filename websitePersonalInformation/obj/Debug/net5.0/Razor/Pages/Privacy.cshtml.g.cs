      <h2>Why I choose this Program?</h2>
 <p>Previously, I studied Business/Commerce stream in senior secondary examinations. My aim was to setup a goal where I can grab knowledge of technology and then implement it through business for a better career. For that, I did Masters and Bachelors in Computer Science Applications. I worked on various pro bono projects of website building and  Android Application development during training. I am quite interested in this course because it offers ample of opportunities for practical experience.  To materialize this goal of mine, I planned to seek a course where I can take internet application and web development as field of study so that I can work towards my dream of starting business based on web application development.</p>
